## A Brief overview of PCOIN

PCOIN is a privacy-centric coin, that introduced the zk-SNARKs based financial data protection protocol on a Proof of Stake blockchain. This protocol was given the name SHIELD.

## Getting Started with PCOIN

The first thing you will need is a wallet to hold your PCOINs. The PCOIN Core Wallet is the solution that offers the most advantages:

- It has all the functionalities of the PCOIN network available natively
- It is the most secure option
- Running the Core Wallet adds a full node to the blockchain, so you contribute to running the PCOIN network

## Buying PCOIN

Once your wallet is up and running, you need to pick an exchange and buy your first PCOINs using either Fiat money or another Cryptocurrency.

You can then transfer your PCOINs from the exchange to your core wallet.

## The PCOIN Rewards system

All blockchain communities that are decentralized have some sort of rewards system for people who help secure their network.
In PCOIN, anyone who has PCOIN can help secure the network and is able to receive rewards for their efforts by contributing to the proof-of-stake mechanism.

The first two methods below are two ways you can use your PCOIN to earn interest on what you already have. If you don’t have PCOIN, but you want to earn some, the third method allows your to earn by helping the community.

#### Method 1 – Running a Masternode

Running a Masternode, which requires 250,000 PCOIN.

#### Method 2 – Stake Your PCOIN

Staking your PCOIN, which has no required minimum, but requires you to keep a core wallet active.

#### Method 3 – Helping Out

There are also opportunities available all the time to help out with community projects funded by PCOIN. If you help these projects along, you become eligible to earn PCOIN for your time and work. These opportunities include development, marketing, customer support, and more.

#### Amounts distributed

Every block (approx. 60 seconds), 12 PCOIN are created (Also sometimes called minting), which are then automatically divided into three pieces:

- 2 PCOIN goes into a pool (The Treasury Budget) that is used to fund the growth of PCOIN. Allocations are voted upon by the Masternodes owners as part of the monthly treasury allocations.
- 5 PCOIN are randomly distributed to the staker who validated the block.
- 5 PCOIN are distributed to a Masternode owner.

The reward system by design has a lot of randomness built into it. This is done for security purposes, and it makes it impossible to predict returns exactly.
