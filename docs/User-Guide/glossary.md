### Glossary of the main PCOIN terms and definitions

**Proof of Stake:** The Proof of Stake (PoS) concept states that a person can mine or validate block transactions according to how many coins they hold. This means that the more coins owned by a miner, the more mining power they have (by opposition to Proof-Of-Work, where the mining power of an actor is linked to his computing power).

**Staking:** The mechanism by which miners (called stakers) are rewarded for adding new blocks to the PCOIN Proof-Of-Stake blockchain.

**PCOIN:** The currency unit of PCOIN.

**zk-SNARKS/SHIELD:** Privacy protocol implemented on the PCOIN blockchain. Zero-Knowledge proof (zk-SNARKS) is a cryptographic method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true, without conveying (or unknowingly leaking) any information apart from one simple statement: that the statement being made is indeed true. PCOIN uses this mechanism to create SHIELD transactions, for which details are only visible to the sender and receiver.

**Masternode:** PCOIN Masternodes are special wallets that, in exchange of the locking-up of a 250'000 PCOIN collateral, provide a second level of governance on the network, with functionalities such as voting on the Treasury Budget.

**Treasury Budget:** A monthly budget of 86'400 PCOIN that are allocated to community-submitted projects that are then voted upon by the PCOIN masternode owners.
