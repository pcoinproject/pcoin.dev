The PCOIN blockchain is a Proof of Stake system that encourages its users to secure and operate the network by staking their coins.

Stakers are responsible for adding new blocks to the blockchain, and receive rewards when they do so.
For each new block added to the blochain (every 60 seconds), 5 PCOIN are created and paid to the staker who wrote the block (i.e. staking rewards will always be a 5 PCOIN payment).

The frequency on which you can expect to receive rewards depend on the amount you are staking.

### Requirements to stake PCOIN

To start staking you will need:

- A PCOIN balance with at least 600 confirmations,
- A PCOIN Core Wallet that is:
  - Running the latest PCOIN release.
  - Synchronized to the latest block.
  - Unlocked for staking.
  - Open and connected to the internet 24/7.

For cold staking your staking node needs to meet all above conditions and have whitelisted its delegation for staking.

Any PCOIN holder can stake their coins; there is no minimum balance.

:::tip
Although you can stake as little as 1 PCOIN, the probability to receive a staking reward will be extremely low.

### How do I start

You first need to decide whether hot or cold staking works best for you.

As mentioned in the requirements section, you need a PCOIN Core Wallet connected to the internet 24/7 to stake your PCOINs.
You can either stake your PCOINs using the Core Wallet that contains your PCOINs (hot staking), or leave the wallet staking your PCOINs offline and delegate the staking to another online wallet (cold staking).

Running your own staking node is generally the preferred option, as it provides additional nodes (thus further decentralization) to the PCOIN network, but it might not be a viable/profitable option for smaller PCOIN balances.

So if you have a server/computer (even a Raspberry PI works!) available for staking, go ahead and start Hot Staking.
If hot staking is not practical for you, then go ahead and delegate your PCOINs for Cold Staking.

:::tip
Cold Staking makes it slightly more cumbersome to spend your PCOINs. So if you transact with your PCOINs a lot hot staking might be the best option.
