# PCOIN Improvement Proposals (PIPs)

PCOIN projects need a way how to document their technical decisions and features. Therefore:

PIP stands for PCOIN Improvement Proposal. Similar to Bitcoin's BIPs, and Dash's DIPs, a PIP is a design document providing: information to the PCOIN community, or a description of a new feature for the PCOIN Standard Wallet (PSW), or a description of its processes or environment. Each PIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

Because PSW is forked from the PIVX codebase, that is also forked from Dash codebase, that is also forked from Bitcoin codebase, many of the BIPs and DIPs can be applied to PSW as well.

## Contributions

We use the same general guidelines for introducing a new PIP as specified in [BIP 2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawiki), with a few differences. Specifically:

- Instead of the BIP editor, initiate contact with the PCOIN development team and your request should be routed to a PIP editor(s). The PIP workflow mimics the DIP/BIP workflow.
- Recommended licenses include the MIT license
- Markdown format is the preferred format for PIPs
- Having a PIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.
